QueryFlow â€” Natural Language to SQL for Relational Databases
==========================================================

NLQuery is an intelligent Natural Language Processing (NLP) layer that enables seamless communication and interaction with relational databases. It converts unstructured natural language prompts into safe, explainable SQL queries and provides results in human-friendly formats. QueryFlow pairs NLQuery with connection management, prompt templates, result validation, and optional execution safeguards so teams can integrate conversational data access into apps and tooling.

Key features
- Translate plain English (and other supported languages) into SQL for popular RDBMS (Postgres, MySQL, SQLite, etc.).
- Intent and slot extraction to improve query accuracy and parameterization.
- Query validation and sandboxing options to reduce risk of unsafe operations.
- Result formatting and post-processing (tables, JSON, summaries).
- Easy integration hooks for web backends, CLIs, or data tools.

Quick start
1. Install (example)
    - Using pip: pip install queryflow
    - Or add as a dependency to your project.

2. Configure a datasource
    - Provide a DB connection string (environment variable or config file).
    - Optionally register allowed tables/columns and read-only mode for safety.

3. Use NLQuery
    - Initialize the NLQuery client with your datasource and optional model settings.
    - Send a plain language prompt and receive an interpretable SQL query and structured results.

Example usage (conceptual)
- Prompt: "Show total sales by region for the last quarter where revenue > 10000"
- NLQuery returns:
  - Generated SQL (parameterized)
  - Execution plan or safety warnings (if enabled)
  - Formatted results (CSV / JSON / markdown table)
  - Human-readable explanation of the query

Configuration & safety
- Prompt templates: Customize how natural language is converted to SQL to match your schema and style.
- Parameterization: All user inputs are treated as parameters to prevent injection.
- Read-only mode: Prevents any modifying statements (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE).
- Whitelisting: Restrict accessible tables, schemas, or columns.

Extensibility
- Add adapters for additional databases or query engines.
- Plug custom post-processors to transform results (e.g., charts, summaries).
- Integrate with authentication layers and audit logs for production deployments.

Testing & validation
- Unit-test prompt-to-SQL mappings for critical flows.
- Use a sandbox DB for integration tests.
- Validate generated SQL against schema introspection to catch column/table mismatches.
